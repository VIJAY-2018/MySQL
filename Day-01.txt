================ Database ================
What is a database?
- A collection of data and holds this data in the form of tables.

What is a table?
- Holds the data in the form of rows and columns

* It is similar to excel spreadsheet

Ques: Why don't we use excel spreadsheet to store the data rather than database?
Ans: What if we have 1000's of excel sheet, it will be tedious to access excel sheet. On the other hand, handling the database
    would be easier since it provides various other functionalities.

* The database provides us the capability to access and manipulate this data.

================ Types of databases ================

1. Relational database 
    - Data is stored in the form of rows and columns. 
    - And tables will have relations b/w them.
    - Eg: MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MariaDB
    - MySQL is used widely, so we will use this.

2. No SQL database
    - Key value pairs.
    - Document.
    - Graph.
    - Tables will not have relations b/w them.
    - Eg: HBase, MongoDB, Cassandra

================ How the databases differ from each other? ================

- They don't differ in terms of the SQL statement we write.
- Rather they differ in terms of the feature they offer. Eg: Security

================ SQL ================

1. Structured Query Language used to query a Relational DB.
2. This Language is used to deal with Structured data which is in the form of rows and columns.
3. SQL is a Language through which we interact with the databases.
4. Eg: SQL is a way to interact with MySQL MariaDB.
5. SQL holds good for all the Relational databases.

================ Installation ================

1. goormIDE (No local Installation required) : https://ide.goorm.io/my/dashboard#/containers/new
2. mysql-ctl cli 
3. mysql> show databases; --> to get the list of databases which are already present.
4. To clear goormIDE terminal, Ctrl + L
5. mysql> create database trendytech; --> to create database
6. mysql> show databases;
7. mysql> drop database trendytech; --> to drop the database

================ How to get into database or change the database? ================

1. USE <Database_Name>;
2. USE trendytech;

================ How to check which Database we are currently using ? ================

1. select database();

================ How to create table ? ================

1. CREATE TABLE employee (
    name varchar(),
    age INT,
    salary INT
);

================ How to see list of tables inside a database we are connected ? ================

1. show tables;

================ How to see the structure of a table inside a database we are connected ? ================

1. describe employee;
2. desc employee;

================ How to drop tables/database ? ================

1. drop table employee;
2. drop database trendytech;

select database(); --> will give NULL since no database present

3. create database trendytech;
4. CREATE TABLE trendytech.employee 
    (
    name varchar(50),
    age INT,
    salary INT
    );

5. show tables; --> will give NULL because we aren't yet connected to any DB.
5. use trendytech;
6. show tables;
