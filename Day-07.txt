-- In the previous session, the below query has given an error
Error: Expression #1 of ORDER BY clause is not in SELECT list, references column 'trendytech.students.enrollment_date' which
is not in SELECT list; this is incompatible with DISTINCT

SELECT DISTINCT source_of_joining from students ORDER BY enrollment_date DESC;

-- Why the above query has given error ?
* We are doing DISTINCT & ORDER BY together here

==> That's why SQL has given error because Logically things are going wrong
