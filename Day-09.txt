AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
-------------------

-----
COUNT
-----
-- To count the number of rows in the table
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;

-- To count the companies from where students are enrolling for a course
SELECT COUNT(student_compnany) from students;

-- To count the unique companies from where students are enrolling for a course
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT student_compnany) AS companies from students;

-- To check from which all locations people are joining the course
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT location) from students;

-- To check from which all different sources people are joining the course
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT source_of_joining) from students;

-- Find the number of students who have enrolled for August batch
SELECT COUNT(*) from students where batch_date LIKE '%-08-%';

GROUP BY
--------

-- Group the data based on some Logically
-- All the people who works in Walmart can be grouped together.
-- All the people who works in Microsoft can be grouped together.

Eg:
-- How many people have joined the course got to know about Trendytech through

linkedin - 5
google - 2
quora - 1

-- We have to do the GROUP BY on source_of_joining column

SELECT source_of_joining, count(*) from students GROUP BY source_of_joining;

** If we are grouping something then that column must always be there in SELECT query otherwise we will get an error

SELECT location, count(*) from students GROUP BY source_of_joining; -- Incorrect query

ERROR 1055 (42000): Expression #1 of SELECT list is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column 'trendytech.students.location
' which is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by

-- Find the number of students who have joined the course through different locations

SELECT location, count(*) from students GROUP BY location;

-- From Banglore location and source_of_joining is linkedin how many students have enrolled ?

-- GROUP BY on two columns
SELECT location, source_of_joining, count(*) from students group by location, source_of_joining;

-- For each course how many people are enrolled
SELECT course_name, COUNT(*) from students GROUP BY course_name;
