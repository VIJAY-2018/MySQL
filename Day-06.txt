DISTINCT, ORDER BY, LIMIT, LIKE
-------------------------------

---------
DISTINCT 
---------

==> DISTINCT fetches the distinct records.

select location from students; -- It will also contain duplicate data

select DISTINCT location from students;

-- Which all company do the students work ?
select DISTINCT student_compnany from students;

-- From which all sources people are knowing about Trendytech ?
select DISTINCT source_of_joining from students;

---------
ORDER BY
---------

==> ORDER BY sorts the data.

select student_id, enrollment_date, selected_course, student_fname, years_of_exp, student_compnany, 
batch_date, source_of_joining, location from students ORDER BY years_of_exp;

select student_fname from students ORDER BY student_fname;

select student_fname from students ORDER BY years_of_exp;

-- Student with highest years of experience on top

select student_fname from students ORDER BY years_of_exp DESC;

select student_fname, years_of_exp from students ORDER BY years_of_exp, student_fname;

-- The above query will order by years_of_exp and then it will order by student_fname

-----
LIMIT
-----

-- Fetch the first 3 records
select * from students LIMIT 3;

** LIMIT has to be used along with ORDER BY in order to get the meaningful results.

-- Fetch the details of 3 candidates who have the least experience

select student_id, enrollment_date, selected_course, student_fname, years_of_exp, student_compnany, 
batch_date, source_of_joining, location from students ORDER BY years_of_exp LIMIT 3;

-- Fetch the details of 3 candidates who have the highest experience

select student_id, enrollment_date, selected_course, student_fname, years_of_exp, student_compnany, 
batch_date, source_of_joining, location from students ORDER BY years_of_exp DESC LIMIT 3;

-- Fetch the details of source of joining of last 5 candidates who have joined trendytech

select source_of_joining from students ORDER BY enrollment_date DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Fetch the distinct details of source of joining of last 5 candidates who have joined trendytech

-- The below query won't work [Will discuss in next session]
select DISTINCT source_of_joining from students ORDER BY enrollment_date DESC LIMIT 5;

Error: Expression #1 of ORDER BY clause is not in SELECT list, references column 'trendytech.students.enrollment_date' which is not in SELECT list; this is incompatible
 with DISTINCT

-- Fetch the details of the last candidate who has enrolled for trendytech

select student_id, enrollment_date, selected_course, student_fname, years_of_exp, student_compnany, 
batch_date, source_of_joining, location from students ORDER BY enrollment_date DESC LIMIT 1;

-- The below query will give the first 3 records, same as LIMIT 3
select * from students ORDER BY enrollment_date LIMIT 0,3;

-- The below query will give the 4th and 5th records, 0-->1-->2-->3(4th record)-->4(5th record)
select * from students ORDER BY enrollment_date LIMIT 3,2;

LIKE
